                Two households, both alike in dignity,</br>
                In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</br>
                From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</br>
                Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</br>
                From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</br>
                A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</br>
                Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</br>
                Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</br>
                The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</br>
                And the continuance of their parents' rage,</br>
                Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</br>
                Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</br>
                The which if you with patient ears attend,</br>
                What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</br>
